## Usage

This section explains all functionality which Lunaro Manager offers. Every
action will be replied to with a (selectively ephemeral) message.

### `‚ùì /help`

Guides to the Discord command explorer to discover all commands, and also links
to this GitHub section.

### `üèì /ping`

Check if Lunaro Manager is online and how long it took to receive the ping. This
value is calculated from the system time, and may thus be inaccurate.

### `üü¢ /rtp join`

Adds the configured RTP role to your profile.

### `‚≠ï /rtp leave`

Removes the configured RTP role from your profile.

### `üëÄ /rtp info`

Lists the number of members with the RTP role.

### `‚õî /tracking pause`

Disables activity tracking for your account. This is useful because the activity
tracker will otherwise override your manually set RTP status.

### `‚ö° /tracking resume`

Resumes activity tracking for your account.

### `üí° /about`

Displays details about Lunaro Manager, including

- Number of members whose activity is being tracked
- Deno, TypeScript and discordeno versions
- Time of last update (based on last commit to `main` branch)
- Current uptime

### `ü§ù /contribute`

Displays a link to this GitHub page, encouraging the creation of issues and
pull requests.

### `üîé /config activity-tracking [enabled: boolean]`

Globally enables or disabled activity tracking based on the `enabled` option. *This Command is supposed to be admin-only. Please configure accordingly.*

## Setup

1. Create a bot on https://discord.com/developers

2. Enable `PRESENCE` & `SERVER MEMBERS` intents in the Bot section

3. Create a `.env` file following the example of [.env.example](.env.example)

4. Run the bot (see next sections)

## Running the bot

### Run locally

You need to have [Deno](https://deno.land) installed. Cache the dependencies to
make compilation faster later on.

```sh
$ deno cache src/**/*.ts   # deno task does not currently support globs
$ deno task start
```

During development, installing [`denon`](https://deno.land/x/denon) is highly
recommended for convenience.

```sh
$ deno task start:watch
```

### Run in Docker

```sh
$ docker-compose up --build -d
```
